# MandelBrot
This program runs a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set. The black area is everything within the Mandelbrot set. The color represents how fast a complex number escapes. Below is a zoom into the seahorse valley of the Mandelbrot set. This project utilizes SFML 3.0 for rendering. Enjoy the visuals!
